## general / common sound library

just a preemptive set of a couple parser modules for midi,
soundfont, impulse-tracker and other stuff.

The idea of most any parser here is almost strictly for 
interpretation.

The library was predominantly inspired by curiosity in how
some sound formats and/or sound engines work.

More notes to come later...
