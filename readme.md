## general / common sound library

just a meager, preemp general sound library – mostly serving as a self-education in general digital audio

a set of a couple parser modules for midi, soundfont, impulse-tracker and other stuff.

The idea of most any parser here is almost strictly for interpretation of a few media formats.  If anything, I was interested in writing a sample-import/export librarian tool, however many of the components were first authored in VB6, and as my understanding evolved, this project migrated first to C/CPP, then DOTNETv1.0—then finally, years later: DOTNETv4.x;
Hence the mess.

More notes to come later...
