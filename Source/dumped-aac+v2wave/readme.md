Dumped aac+v2wave-NAudio-1.7.1.17
=======================================

This is a old app framework that was stripped to prototype something that I could use to
collect sample-data from seemingly arbitrary input using NAudio's MediaFoundation implementation.

Demonstrated here:

- Play shoutcast AAC+ audio (dumps: see bullet below)
- Using the semantics, `LoadURL` (or something like that) to play-back
  live shoutcast mp3 and aac streams provided you select the appropriate drop-down
  sample-resolution setting.
